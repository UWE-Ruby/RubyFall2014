Instructions for Mid-Term submission and Git Review (10pts):
 - Create a git repository for your answers
 - Add and Commit as you work through the questions and programming problems
 - Your git log should reflect your work, don't just commit after you have finished working
 - Use .gitignore to ignore any files that are not relevant to the midterm
 - E-mail me your ssh public key
 - I will email you back with your repository name
 - Add a remote to your git repository: git@reneedv.com:RubyFall2014/YOURREPOSITORYNAME.git
 - Push your changes to the remote
 - After 6pm Thursday November 13th you will not be able to push to your remote repository (or clone).

Questions (20pts):
 1 - What are the three uses of the curly brackets {} in Ruby? 
   A: Create a hash, string interpolation, and to specify a code block inline  

 2 - What is a regular expression and what is a common use for them?
   A: a sequences of characters for identifying a certain search pattern. Often used for matching, replacing, and validating strings or other data. 

 3 - What is the difference between how a String, a symbol, a FixNum, and a Float are stored in Ruby?
   A: String is stored as a separate object ID every time it is saved. Symbols and fixnums are stored as the same object ID. A float object is an inexact number stored as a representation. 

 4 - Are these two statements equivalent? Why or Why Not?
   1. x, y = "hello", "hello"
   2. x = y = "hello"
   A: No they are not equivalent. #1 creates two objects that are both equal to different separate hello strings. #2 creates three objects that are all the same as hello string. 

5 - What is the difference between a Range and an Array?
  A: A range is represented as a beginning and ending point and all items in-between are inferred. An array specifies all individual items in a list and each has a distinct position. 

6 - Why would I use a Hash instead of an Array?
  A: A hash gives you ability to define each value with a  key and call on that value with the key. An array uses positions to identify items in its set. YOu would use a hash when you have distinct pairs of data and want to have rapid lookup ability. You would use an array when you just have a list that you want to keep in a distinct order. 

7 - What is your favorite thing about Ruby so far?
  A: I like that you don't have to end everything in brackets and that white spacing is not a big deal. 

8 - What is your least favorite thing about Ruby so far?
  A: I don't like all the idiomatic knowledge that has to be acquired through experience (there's a way that works, a best way, a better way, and way bestest way). 

 Programming Problems (10pts each):
 - Write a passing rspec file called even_number_spec.rb that tests a class called EvenNumber.
    - The EvenNumber class should:
       - Only allow even numbers
       - Get the next even number
       - Compare even numbers
       - Generate a range of even numbers
- Make the rspec tests in wish_list_spec.rb pass by writing a WishList class
   - The WishList class should:
      - Mixin Enumerable
      - Define each so it returns wishes as strings with their index as part of the string

Mid-Term Spec (50pts):
- Make the tests pass.
