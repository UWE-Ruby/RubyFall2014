1. How does Ruby read files?

Ruby reads a line from a standard input or files specified when gets or file.gets is used. 
There are also iterators you can use to read files. IO#each_byte iterates over 8-bit bytes from the IO object. IO#each_line calls the block with each line from the file. IO#foreach opens the file to read, calls the block on one line from the file then closes the file. IO#read gets an entire file into a string or into an array of lines.

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?

File.open(“my_output.txt”, “w”) do |file|
    file.puts “Hello World!”
end

puts File.read(“my_output.txt”)
