1. How does Ruby read files?
  Ruby reads files similar to how it can get steams from the console.   
  If a filename was passed to ruby after the ruby script itself, then the Kernel 'gets' will lines from the 
  file instead of the console.   A File object can also be created with a file path (File.new("filename", "r"))
  and then #gets can be called on the file object to get lines of text, or #read to read an arbitrary number of bytes
  from the file.

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?
  f = File.new("my_output.txt", "w")
  f.puts("Hello World!")
  f.close

3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?
  The Dir class lets ruby inspect directories in the underlying file system.   For example Dir.entries("/") returns an
  array containing all the filename of the files in the root directory of the system.

4. What is an IO object?
  The IO class is the basis for input and output in ruby.   It is the base class of File and the socket classes like 
  TCPSocket and UDPSocket.   It defines the methods such as #gets, #puts, #read and #print that read or write steams of 
  characters.

5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?
