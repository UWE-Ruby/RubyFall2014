1. How does Ruby read files?

A: Call File.open on the file in the file system, and then use a block to call something on the file object iterator, typically something like the each_line method. Each line will yield a string value for line of the file. 

File.open("aFile.txt") do |file|
  file.each_line {|line| puts  line }
end

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?

A: Call File open on my_output.txt, passing a "w" for as the mode param (write), and then call puts "Hello World!" on the resulting file object.

File.open("my_output.txt" "w") do |file|
  file.puts "Hello World!"
end

3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?

A: The directory class is a standard ruby library class that represent directories (folders) within a host machine's local file system. It provides multiple methods to enumerate directories and files within those directories. 

4. What is an IO object?

A: An IO object is a bidirectional channel between a Ruby program and external resources like files or sockets. Files and sockets are subclasses of the IO object and support similar interfaces. 

5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?

A: Rake is a build utility that is used to provide an easy to use domain specific language to define/automate common tasks that a developer may commonly run within a ruby project. A rake task is similar to a function, you can call a particular rake task by name and it will run whatever operations defined for that task. A task example might be setting some environment variable used by a ruby program.
