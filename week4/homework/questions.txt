1. How does Ruby read files?

  You can read files in Ruby using the File class; once a File object is created to open a file, its contents can be read using File methods such as "gets" (reads a line from the file) "read" (reads the entire contents of the file to a string), or iterators like "each_byte" (reads the next byte)

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?

  File.open("my_output.txt","w") do |file|
    file.puts "Hello World!"
  end

3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?

  The Directory class is used to represent and manipulate directories in the file system.  Dir methods can be used to create directories, delete directories, and iterate over directory contents.

4. What is an IO object?

  An IO object is a class used to allow your Ruby program to interact with (write to and read from) an external resource.

5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?

  I couldn't access the site listed above - rubyforge appears to be gone - but found some material on the web.  Rake is a build tool, used to automate the work associated with setting up an application.  A task is a unit of work to be executed by Rake. Tasks are specified in a rakefile.
