5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?
Rake is a build utility that uses Ruby code. It organizes and automates tasks. It takes
a tasks and breaks it down into component pieces and then specifies what
needs to be done in order to do the bigger task. All tasks have
dependencies and they need to be in the right order to execute
correctly. (I got that info from a lecture I found online by Jim
Weirich.)
A rake task is code that perform automated tasks. On my
website, I use rake to send appointment reminders to nannnies and
parents. I use a cron to activate the rake task. I have a rake task to
change passwords on my development server. I only run that every now
and then.
