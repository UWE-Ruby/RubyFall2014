PLEASE NOTE: In the assigned text book, chapter 10 is "Exceptions, catch and throw." The chapter "Basic Input and Output" is chapter 11. I was unable to connect to RubyForge.org; the site's Wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyForge) noted that the site was shut down in May, 2014.


1. How does Ruby read files?

Ruby reads files using the File class, which is a descendant of the IO class.


2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?

# Using this syntax, the file closes automatically
# when the loop goes out of scope.

File.open("my_output.txt", "w") do |f|
    f.puts("Hello, World!")
end


3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?

I wasn't able to find anything about a Directory class.


4. What is an IO object?

An instance of the IO class. As such, it contains a bidirectional channel that allows a Ruby application to communicate with an external resource, such as a keyboard, monitor, or file.
