Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?

An Array is a list of object references. They are indexed by
integers. A Hash is also a list of object references but there are 2
objects and they are in pairs (keys and their values). A hash is
indexed with any type of object (symbols, strings, regular expressions)

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?

An Array is used when you have a list of items and need to iterate
over the list and return the items in it.  I'd also use an Array when
I know I need to return the first n items.

A Hash can create a more complex data structure. You can create a hash
of hashes or arrays which can hold more associated data than an Array
since an array can only be indexed by an integer. If I have lots of
different references to store (a book, it's author, her birthday)I'd
use a Hash.


3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?

Modules are a way of grouping together methods, classes and
constants. They provide a namespace and prevent name(p. 73)
clashes. They support the mixin facility.

(note to me: A module can't have instances because it's not a class.
You can include a module within a class definition. Then all the
module's instance methods are available as methods in the class as
well. A mixed-in module behaves like a superclass.)

Enumerable implements methods in terms of the host class's each
method. Any class that includes the Enumerable object and uses the
method each can use Enumerable's methods. Some of Enumerable's methods
are map, sort_by, select, next, with_index. These are all methods that
allow me create data structures, change them and keep track of
them. I need to use each to use them.


4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?

No. You can use a module so your names are protected.


5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
A module can't have instances. It has to be included in a file so it's
methods can be used by the Class. Modules group classes together. A
Classes are the things I deal with (ie. in my software I have a User class
that holds all of my users, an Appointment class that holds all the
appointments). Using modules I can bring that data together to change
it or track it or whatever I am doing with it.

I know I've used modules and I think I basically understand what they
are. Classes seem more clear to me though.
