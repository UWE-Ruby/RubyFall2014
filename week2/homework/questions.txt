Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?

Indexing of array elements will be with Integers where Hash elements can be indexed with any type of elements, doesn't need to be integer . This makes hash indexing will not be in order, but by key value.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?

Array might be preferred over Hash when order of the elements is known ( especially when elements are less in number).
Hash is preferred over Array when elements can be accesssed by key value.

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?

Module is a collection of methods and constants. 

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?

mixins in Ruby will be helpful in sharing code.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?

Modules are about providing methods that you can use across multiple classes. We can think about them as "libraries" . Classes are about objects; modules are about functions.
