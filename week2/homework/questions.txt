Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
The difference between an Array and a Hash is the type of object used to
index the collection.  An Array is indexed using an integer. A Hash is
indexed using any type of object.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
An Array is naturally used for collections that have a clean linear
structure that intuitively maps to an increasing set of natural numbers
(whole integers).  A Hash is used when the index object presents a  more
complex index configuration or you need to map one object to another.

3. What is a module?
From www.ruby-doc.org 
"A module is a collection of methods and constants.  The methods in a
module may be instance methods or module methods.  Instance methods 
appear as methods in a class when the module is included, module methods
do not.  Conversely, module methods may be called without creating an
encapsulating object, while instance methods may not."

A module is similar to a class but it can have no subclasses or instances.

A module is defined by:
module .....
	.
	.
	.
end


Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
From www.ruby-doc.org 
"The Enumerable mixin provides collection classes with several traversal
and searching methods, and the ability to sort.  The class must provide a
method each, which yields successive members of the collection.  If
Enumerable#max, #min, or #sort is used, the objects in the collection 
must also implement a meaningful <=> operator, as these methods rely on 
an ordering between members of the collection."

Ruby docs calls Enumerable a "mix-in" and not a module.  So a module and 
a mix-in must be the same thing.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? 
Ruby is designed for single inheritance, so a Ruby class can have only 
one direct parent.  

How could you get around this problem?
The Ruby language supports mixins which are similar to classes in some 
respects.  A controlled type of multiple-inheritance-type behaviour may 
achieved using Ruby mixins.


5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
A Ruby Class and a Ruby Module are very similar.  However, a Ruby Module
should not support or encode object state information.  If object state 
information is needed then a Class should be written.
