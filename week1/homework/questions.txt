p.86-90 Strings (Strings section in Chapter 6 Standard Types)

1. What is an object?
An object represents data that can be manipulated.

2. What is a variable?
A reference to an object. They are used to keep track of objects.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
A class is each named thing that the code needs to find answers or do
work.
(ie a User class that represents all the users about whom I collect
information. A class does not change.
Information that the class represents can change ). An object
represents data within the class that can be changed.
The user object is used when I collect data about my users.

4. What is a String?
objects of class String. They can hold printable characters or binary data.

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint:
   think methods
   Chomp, Split, Squeeze

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between them?
double quotes, single quotes. Double quoted strings support more
escape sequences. I think this is because everything between single
quotes in interpreted literally - so \n would print \n if it's between
single quotes.
