5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods

String objects can take .squeeze, .scan, and .chomp.



6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between them?

A String literal can be defined by using a pair of single quotes or a pair of double quotes. Ruby being Ruby, there are ways to use alternate delimiters as either single or double quotes. Ruby being Ruby, there is also a third way to define a String literal, the "here document" syntax.

With the single quote option, only the escape sequences for the backslash and single quote will be processed; all other escape sequences will be treated as separate characters. With the double quote option, all escape sequences will be treated as escape sequences. Double-quoted strings will also parse the #{} syntax.
