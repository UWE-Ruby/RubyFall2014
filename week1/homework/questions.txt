1. What is an object?

An object is a data structure that interacts with its own code, in other words, anything we manipulate in Ruby.

2. What is a variable?

A variable labels and holds data, like an integer or a string.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?

An object is a class instance and a class contains class instances. 
Classes contain objects that interact with methods and each other.

4. What is a String?

A string is a sequence of characters that are sometimes printable. In Ruby, there are many built-in methods
that can be used on strings.

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods

String#split, String#scan, String#chomp.

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between them?

To define a String literal you can use single quotes (‘ ’), double quotes (“ “), %q, %Q, or here documents. 
%q and %Q are the same as single quotes and double quotes. 
Here documents are treated as a section of source code and they can be used to create multiline strings.
