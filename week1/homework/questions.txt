Chapter 3 Classes, Objects, and Variables
p.86-90 Strings (Strings section in Chapter 6 Standard Types)

1. What is an object?
Everything in Ruby is an object. All objects have an identity and an internal state (such as the example from our text, title and artist).
Object is the default root of all Ruby objects. Object also inherits from ÔBasicObjectÕ which allows creating alternate object hierarchies.
In other words, any piece of data is data is an object, like the number 6 or the string 'World'.

2. What is a variable?
Variables are used to keep track of objects; each variable holds a reference to an object. In other words, a variable is a reference to an object.
Objects are in a big pool and being pointed to by variables.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
Ruby separates everything into classes, like integers, floats and strings. An object is a unit of data and a class is what kind of data it is.
For instance, the number 1 and 7 are different numbers and they are different objects; however, they are both integer so they are in the same class.

4. What is a String?
The word we use for groups of letters is string; hence it is simply a sequence of characters. For instance ÔHelloÕ, ÔRuby is powerfulÕ and ÔHello WorldÕ. Notice once Ruby treats it as string it does not do addition.
irb(main):002:0> "1" + "2"
=> "12"

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
String#split (pass /\S*\|\S*/ splits the line into tokens wherever split find a vertical bar or surrounded by spaces)
String#chomp (chomp removes carriage return characters, \n, \r and \r\n)
String#squeeze (trims runs of repeated characters)


6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between them?
When a string appears literally in source code, it is known as string literal. String literals are enclosed by single or double quotes

%q -- think of it as a thin quote as in Ô
%Q -- think of it as a thick quote as in Ò

Single quote does string interpolation
Escape sequence (escaped character) does not work in single quote
