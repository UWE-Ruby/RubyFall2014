Rick Crelia - week 1 homework


1. What is an object?

An object is the realization or instantiation of a class. 

2. What is a variable?

A variable is a reference to an object. There are different types of variables: local variables,
instance variables, class variables, global variables, etc. 

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?

A class is a representation of something, that defines its state as well as ways in which it can 
be used (methods). An object is the result of instantiating a class. 

4. What is a String?

A string is a sequence of characters, pure and simple. Characters can be text or binary. 

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods

String is one of the largest built-in Ruby classes, with over 100 standard methods.

Some string methods include: 

 a. String.split = parse characters into fields using a specified delimiter
 b. String.squeeze = strip out repeated characters in a run of characters
 b. String.scan = match chunks of characters using a specified pattern/regex.

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between them?

 a. Single/thin quotes  -  my_thinString = 'huzzah'
 b. Double/thick quotes -  my_thickString = "huzzah"

 Single quoted strings have fewer ways of being interpolated compared to double-quoted strings. The 
 latter can even include Ruby code to create dynamic string expressions.
