6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between them?
strings are delimited by special characters at the beginning and end of the string.  Ruby has several forms of delimeters: single quotes, double quotes, %{} where { and } may be any pair of braces ({,[,etc).  There are also here documents which begin <<ANY_END_DELIMETER string ANY_END_DELIMETER.  the difference between single and double quote strings is that single quote strings only allow \\ and \' escapes where double quotes allows a much greater variety of escape sequences including \n, and #{ code }.
